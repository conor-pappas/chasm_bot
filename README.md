# CHeeky Asynchronous Scrum Master Bot

A Slack Bot written to help coordinate Scrum voting sessions. Certain users can be designated a scrum master and post issues that need discusion and voting. Users can respond with questions, concerns, or their votes.

Questions that come in are posted to the channel for further discusion.

The goal is to help with smaller tickets that need a vote as requirements change. It's to give teams a tool for discussing and understanding these tickets without needing to pull everybody away from what they are doing.
